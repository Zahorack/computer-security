Lecture 2 - Threat modeling [28.9.2020]

# Attack
Not allowed interaction with system, which cause a damage or enable another attacks.
	Hardware
	Software
	
-use computional resources
-data leaking
-distributed attack

# Secure system development
-disable possibilities for attackers




# Threat modeling

//Book - Adam Shostack: Threat modeling, designing for security

Rule 1: Threat identification in design stage of system development process
-cheaper
-scalability
-efectivity
-user distrubition

Process:
 define model - what are you building?
 find threats - what can go wrong with it once you build it?
 handle threats
 system validation


Strategies
 [ ] Brainstorming
 [ ] Expertise
 [ ] Protocols/Norms
 [ ] Attack trees
 [ ] Data flow diagrams
